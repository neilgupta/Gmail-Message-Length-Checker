Gmail Message Length Checker
============================

A Safari extension for Gmail that displays how long your email will take to read as you type it. The goal is to help you [write shorter emails](http://five.sentenc.es/) that are more likely to get read. **[Download the extension](https://github.com/downloads/neilgupta/Gmail-Message-Length-Checker/gmailmessagelengthchecker.safariextz).**

The extension calculates reading time based on the word count of your email divided by the average reading speed of 250 words per minute. [Read more about calculating reading time](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/06/reading-time-in-textmate/). You can even set the extension to highlight the reading time in red if it exceeds a given amount of time. Keep in mind that the average amount of time spent on an email is 15-20 seconds!
