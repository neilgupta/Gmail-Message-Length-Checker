The extension calculates reading time based on the word count of your email divided by the average reading speed of 250 words per minute. [Read more about calculating reading time](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/06/reading-time-in-textmate/). If your email will take more than 30 seconds to read, the time is highlighted in red to remind you to try shortening the email.
